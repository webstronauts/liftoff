# liftoff ðŸš€

> Liftoff is a script to set up a macOS laptop for development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/webstronauts/liftoff.git && cd liftoff
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less liftoff
```

Liftoff:

```sh
cd liftoff
./liftoff 2>&1 | tee ~/liftoff.log
```
Just follow the prompts and youâ€™ll be fine. ðŸ‘Œ

:warning: Warning: I advise against running [this script](liftoff) unless you understand what itâ€™s doing to your computer.

We created this based on our own preferences; your mileage may vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last Liftoff run will be saved to `~/liftoff.log`. To review it, run `less ~/liftoff.log`.

That's it! :sparkles:

## Acknowledgements

As it's just a modification of [Formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation), all credits should go to [Mina Markham](https://github.com/minamarkham) for doing all the hard work on the scripts. We just prefered a space theme over Beyonce and tweaked it according to our own needs (Zsh over Bash for example).
